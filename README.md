This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks documenting various experiments conducted as part of my master's thesis and research in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and Deep Learning. The notebooks include:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial analysis of benchmark datasets such as UCF101, HMDB51 and UCF50.

Model Development: Experimentation with various deep learning architectures, including ResNet50, Vision Transformers (ViT), and hybrid models for action recognition tasks.

Preprocessing Pipelines: Code for data preprocessing, augmentation, and transformation to optimize performance for HAR.

Performance Evaluation: Notebooks detailing model evaluation metrics, visualizations, and results analysis.

The experiments aim to explore innovative approaches in spatio-temporal representation learning for activity recognition, focusing on leveraging cutting-edge techniques to improve accuracy and efficiency.
